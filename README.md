# Local-Food-Wastage-Management-System-
The local food wastage system collects data on food types, locations, quantities, and expiry dates to identify waste patterns. It generates reports to optimize redistribution, focusing on items near expiry and high-waste areas, helping reduce food loss and improve sustainability in the community.
